Context: While continuously improving, AI technologies create a rise in the automation of job roles, 
and those that are mainly repetitive or routine in nature. 
However, there are differences in the level of risk concerning automation across industries and job types. 
Moreover, understanding which jobs are most at risk due to automation and 
finding the skills that protect employees from becoming obsolete is significant for individuals and business entities in the labor market.

Overview: The objective is to develop a BI and AI-powered solution that performs an analysis on the job automation potential risk across various industries. It is aimed to be working out which job role would have most vulnerability to automation and assess how AI creates opportunities for new roles, while also creating risk for traditional jobs. It will update this solution on the kinds of skills that are in demand and also propose strategies that could be laid down for individuals and companies to reduce the risks from automation.

Research Questions:

Which job roles are most susceptible to automation in the current market?
How does AI-driven automation affect specific industries and job functions?
What skills will be highly demanded as a result of the automation of existing jobs?
How will workers adapt to an increasingly influential presence of AI in the labor market? Hypotheses:

Those jobs that are monotonous or predictably repetitive would face the most likelihood of automation through AI-related technologies.
Manufacturing, transport, and administrative support are more vulnerable than creation and problem-solving.
The demand for skills in AI, machine learning, data analysis, and creative problem-solving will rise.
Among the workers, those who focus on developing their technical and cognitive skills will be more prepared to thrive in an AI-driven job market.
