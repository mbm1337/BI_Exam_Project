# Assessing Job Automation Risk in the AI Era

## Project Annotation
This project focuses on analyzing the risks posed by AI-driven automation to job roles in various sectors. 
By using the "AI-powered Job Market Insights" dataset, the project aims to identify which jobs are most at risk of being automated,
understand the impact of automation across industries, and determine the skills that will remain relevant or grow in demand. 
The expected solution will guide job seekers, employers, and policymakers in navigating the challenges and opportunities presented by AI. 
This solution could positively impact workers by helping them future-proof their careers through upskilling,
while also assisting businesses in strategic workforce planning.

## Context and Purpose
- **Context:** As AI technologies advance, many jobs—especially those involving repetitive tasks—are at risk of automation. This project aims to assess which roles are most vulnerable and provide insights for mitigating the risks.
- **Purpose:** To develop a BI solution that analyzes job automation risk and suggests the skills needed to stay relevant in an AI-driven economy.

## Research Questions
1. Which job roles are most susceptible to automation in the current market?
2. How does AI-driven automation impact specific industries and job functions?
3. What skills will be in high demand due to the automation of existing jobs?
4. How can workers adapt to the growing influence of AI on the labor market?

## Hypotheses
1. Jobs involving repetitive or predictable tasks are at the highest risk of being automated by AI technologies.
2. Industries such as manufacturing, transportation, and administrative services face greater automation risks compared to creative and complex problem-solving roles.
3. Skills related to AI, machine learning, data analysis, and creative problem-solving will see increased demand.
4. Workers who focus on acquiring technical and cognitive skills will be better prepared to thrive in an AI-dominated job market.
